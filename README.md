# Wind vectors

This program visualizes wind velocity vectors onto a map of Northwest Oregon. These vectors are made up of a speed and direction component, taken from the National Weather Service API. Each vector exists at a specific coordinate on a grid overlaid onto the map. As of right now, everything I wanted to do is done. But this program is sort of ugly... learning OpenGL to make prettier models right now!
