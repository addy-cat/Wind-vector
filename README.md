# Wind vectors

The goal of this program is to visualize wind velocity vectors onto a map of Northwest Oregon. These vectors will be made up of a speed and direction component, taken from the National Weather Services API. Each vector will exist at a specific coordinate on a grid overlaid onto the map. As of right now, I have the wind speeds and wind directions of many vectors in their own arrays. I have yet to create the velocity vectors from this data, and plan on learning more about a graphical way to show them.
